# Web-Scraping
To scrape data available in a structured format in websites
Objective: To pull and analyse publicly available physician level information such as name, medical specialty, address, telephone number and fax. 
R code uses xlsx and rvest packages for scraping data present in 1)sublink lists within a webpage that lead to the actual data 2)data present on the webpage itself.
To make things easier, we could download two chrome extensions which are extremely handy to create input sourcelinks file in a csv and identify the web element in which our desired data is present - linkclump and selectorgadget
The code can be extended to different scenarios which involve web scraping of non-physician information
